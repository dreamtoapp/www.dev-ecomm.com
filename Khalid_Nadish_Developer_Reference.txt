            DEVELOPER REFERENCE CERTIFICATE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To whom it may concern,

I am pleased to recommend KHALID NADISH as an outstanding full-stack web developer. During our collaboration on a complex, modern e-commerce project, Khalid demonstrated:

- Deep proficiency with Next.js, TypeScript, and advanced authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Strong debugging and optimization skills, especially in bundle size, server/client boundaries, and environment configuration
- A proactive approach to performance, security, and code quality
- Excellent research skills, always referencing official documentation and best practices
- A collaborative attitude, always seeking feedback and contributing to the developer community

Khalid successfully solved advanced issues involving server-only authentication, polyfill optimization, and modern app directory patterns. His work ethic, curiosity, and commitment to best practices make him a valuable asset to any tech team.

I highly recommend Khalid Nadish for any senior developer, DevOps, or full-stack engineering position.

Sincerely,
