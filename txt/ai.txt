**Objective**:  
act as senior developer useing - Next.js 15.2 (App Router)  
      - React 19 
      - TypeScript 5.0+  
      to Build projects in  Saudi-focused web application using 

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Core Stack**:  
   ** ForntEnd
      - Next.js 15.2 (App Router)  
      - React 19 
      - TypeScript 5.0+  
      -Tailwindcss
      -shadcn
   ** BackEnd
      - Next.js 15.2 (server Actions  )  
      - TypeScript 5.0+  
   ** validation 
      - Zod
   ** context
      - Zustand

2. **Key Features**:  
   - Mandatory Saudi Adaptations:  
     * RTL-first UI (Tailwind + shadcn/ui)  
     * Cultural content validation  
   - Modern React Patterns:  
     * Server Actions (Next.js 15.2)  
   - Essential Integrations:  
     * Next-Auth (Prisma + MongoDB Atlas)  
     * Nodemailer 


3. **Quality Requirements**:  
   - Lighthouse Score ≥95  
   - Zero CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)  
   - AA Accessibility Compliance  
   - ISO-639 Arabic localization standards  




**Key Improvements from Original**:  
1. Structured technical requirements hierarchy  
2. Added concrete performance metrics  
3. Explicit response protocol with JSON schema  
4. Clear separation of cultural vs technical needs  
5. Example-driven validation  
6. Version-specific dependency guidance  
  

 Ask Any Thing Before you start If You ready let's start we have alot to Do !

  Project Scope and Features
Core Features :
Can you provide more details about the key features of the Saudi-focused web application? For example:
Is it an e-commerce platform, a service-based app, or something else? yes it is  e-commerce platform
Are there specific cultural content requirements (e.g., Islamic holidays, local traditions, etc.) that need to be integrated? 
No Need

User Roles : admin acceess all , customer can not access datshboard , driver not access datshboard

Localization :
Beyond Arabic localization, do we need to support other languages (e.g., English for expats)? Should the app dynamically switch between RTL and LTR based on the selected language? ar/en but igonre it for now 
2. Backend and Data Management
Database Schema :
Do you already have a database schema or ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for the project? If not, can you outline the main entities (e.g., users, products, orders, etc.) and their relationships? yes i have it
Authentication :
Will Next-Auth handle all authentication needs, or do we need additional custom logic (e.g., phone number login, OTP verification)?  will use otp throw whats up like tiktok
Should we integrate with Saudi-specific identity providers like Absher or Saudipost ? no need for now
Nodemailer :
What is the primary use case for Nodemailer? (e.g., password resets, order confirmations, newsletters). Do we have SMTP credentials or a service provider (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES)? for all but igonre it for now
3. Frontend and UI/UX
Design System :
Will we use shadcn/ui components out-of-the-box, or should we customize them extensively to match the Saudi aesthetic? use shadcn
Are there specific design guidelines or brand assets (e.g., colors, typography, logos) we need to follow? no  guidelines for now
RTL Adaptation :
Should the entire app default to RTL, or should users have the option to toggle between RTL and LTR? work on RTL Fro now
Are there specific UI patterns or components that need special attention for RTL (e.g., date pickers, dropdowns)? No
Performance :
To achieve a Lighthouse score ≥95, should we prioritize certain optimizations (e.g., image optimization, lazy loading, CDN usage)? yes
Are there specific tools or libraries you prefer for performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Vercel Analytics)? no
4. Validation and Security
Zod Validation :
Do you have examples of the data structures that need validation (e.g., user registration form, product creation form)? No
Should we enforce strict validation rules for cultural content (e.g., disallowing inappropriate words or phrases)? No
Security :
Beyond Next-Auth, are there additional security requirements (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA, GDPR compliance)? No
Should we implement role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive routes or actions? NO
5. Deployment and Infrastructure
Hosting :
Will the app be hosted on Vercel, or do you prefer another platform (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean)? Vercel
Should we set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments? Ignore for now
Environment Variables :
Do you have a preferred method for managing environment variables (e.g., .env files, AWS Secrets Manager)? .env
Monitoring :
Should we integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) for uptime and performance tracking? first time i know about will talk later about
6. Timeline and Deliverables
Milestones :
Do you have a timeline or milestones in mind for delivering the project (e.g., MVP, beta release, final launch)? final 
Should we prioritize certain features for the initial release?
Collaboration :
How will we collaborate during development (e.g., GitHub pull requests, daily standups, weekly reviews)?
Who will handle testing and quality assurance (QA)?
7. Miscellaneous
Third-Party Integrations :
Are there any third-party APIs or services we need to integrate (e.g., payment gateways like STCPay, geolocation services)? Not now
Legal Compliance :
Beyond accessibility (AA compliance), are there other legal or regulatory requirements we need to adhere to (e.g., Saudi data protection laws)? No
Fallback Mechanisms :
Should we implement fallback mechanisms for critical features (e.g., offline mode, retry logic for API calls)? no
