# ðŸš€ Open Source Contribution Highlight

I recently identified and reported a significant performance issue in NextAuth.js v5 beta while working with Next.js (App Router). My investigation revealed that using the `SessionProvider` or client-side hooks triggered large Node.js polyfills (like `crypto`) to be included in the client bundleâ€”even when all authentication was handled server-side. This led to unnecessary bundle bloat and impacted performance.

I created a minimal reproduction, documented the issue thoroughly, and shared my findings with the NextAuth.js community:
