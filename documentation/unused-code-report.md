# Unused Code Report

This report identifies unused components, files, and dependencies in the codebase. Removing these items will help improve maintainability, reduce bundle size, and make the codebase cleaner.

## 1. Unused Files

### Text Files (Likely Backups or Unused Versions)
These files appear to be backups or unused versions of components:

- `app/dashboard/products/porductmangment/components/EmptyState.txt`
- `app/dashboard/products/porductmangment/components/FliterBySupplier.txt`
- `app/dashboard/products/porductmangment/actions/Actions.txt`
- `app/(e-comm)/homepage/component/category/CategoryList copy.txt`
- `noteFile.txt`
- `Khalid_Nadish_Developer_Reference.txt`

### Unused Components
These components appear to be defined but not used elsewhere in the codebase:

- `components/warinig-msg.tsx` - Contains an `EmptyState` component that's duplicated elsewhere
- `components/empty-box.tsx` - May be superseded by other empty state components

### Unused Scripts
These scripts may not be actively used:

- `scripts/analyze-unused-resources.js` - Requires a `report.json` file that may not exist
- `scripts/optimize-images.js` - Path references may be incorrect
- `analyze-bundle.ps1` - PowerShell script that may be replaced by npm scripts
- `open-bundle-report.ps1` - PowerShell script that may be replaced by npm scripts

## 2. Commented-Out Code

Several files contain commented-out code that should be removed:

- `app/layout.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  // <SessionProvider>
  // <head>{head()}</head>
  // </NotificationsProvider>
  ```

- `app/(e-comm)/contact/action/contact.ts`:
  ```tsx
  // import { pusherServer } from '@/lib/pusherSetting';
  ```

- `app/dashboard/suppliers/components/supplier-card.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  // import DeleteSupplierAlert from './DeleteSupplierAlert';
  // import EditSupplierDialog from './EditSupplierDialog';
  ```

## 3. Unused Dependencies

The following dependencies are installed but not used according to `depcheck`:

### Unused DevDependencies
- `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`
- `@types/node`
- `@types/qrcode`
- `autoprefixer`
- `cssnano`
- `depcheck`
- `eslint-config-prettier`
- `eslint-plugin-prettier`
- `glob`
- `postcss`
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`
- `purgecss`
- `webpack`

## 4. Potentially Unused Imports

Several files import components or functions that don't appear to be used in the file:

- In `components/ecomm/Fotter/QuickLinks.tsx`:
  - `Phone`, `Store`, `Users` from 'lucide-react' may be unused

- In `components/image-upload.tsx`:
  - Some imported icons like `ZoomIn`, `X`, `Eye` may be unused

- In `components/ecomm/Header/UserMenu.tsx`:
  - Some imported icons like `BadgeAlert`, `ChevronRight`, `Loader2` may be unused

## 5. Duplicate Functionality

There appear to be multiple components with similar functionality:

- Multiple "Empty State" components:
  - `components/warinig-msg.tsx`
  - `components/empty-box.tsx`
  - `app/(e-comm)/cart/component/empty-cart.tsx`
  - `app/(e-comm)/homepage/component/product/NoProduct.tsx`

## 6. Deprecated or Outdated Files

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` references some deprecated packages:
  - `q@1.5.1` is marked as deprecated
  - `glob@8.1.0` is marked as deprecated
  - `inflight@1.0.6` is marked as deprecated and leaks memory

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Unused Files**: Delete all `.txt` files that are backups or unused versions.

2. **Consolidate Similar Components**: Create a single, reusable empty state component that can be configured with different messages and icons.

3. **Clean Up Dependencies**: Run `pnpm remove` for the unused dependencies listed above.

4. **Remove Commented-Out Code**: Clean up all commented-out code that's no longer needed.

5. **Update Deprecated Packages**: Update or replace deprecated packages to avoid potential issues.

6. **Implement Bundle Analysis**: Use the existing bundle analysis scripts to identify large dependencies and optimize them.

7. **Standardize Error Handling**: Create a consistent approach to error states and empty states throughout the application.

## Next Steps

1. Before removing any files, verify they are truly unused by searching for imports across the codebase.
2. Consider implementing a linting rule to prevent unused imports.
3. Set up regular code cleanup as part of your development workflow.
4. Run performance tests before and after cleanup to measure the impact.
