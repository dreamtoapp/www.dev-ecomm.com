# 🚀 Next.js E-Commerce Performance Optimization Guide

This guide documents all the step-by-step optimization strategies applied to this project. It is designed for both humans and AI assistants to understand and replicate high-performance, production-ready Next.js setups.

---

## 1. Image Optimization

- **Use Next.js `<Image />`:**
  - Replace all `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` for automatic resizing, lazy loading, and format selection.
- **Serve Modern Formats:**
  - Convert and use AVIF and WebP formats for all static images.
  - Place optimized images in the `/public` directory.
- **Avoid Unused Preloads:**
  - Do NOT preload fallback images unless they are above-the-fold and critical.
  - Unused preloads can decrease Lighthouse scores.
- **Hero/Banner Images:**
  - Use `<Image priority placeholder="blur" />` for main visuals to improve LCP.
- **Responsive Images:**
  - Always provide `width`, `height`, and `sizes` attributes.

## 2. Meta Tags & Viewport

- Ensure the following meta tag is present in your main layout/head:
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  ```
- This ensures mobile responsiveness and removes input delay on touch devices.

## 3. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

- Use `next/dynamic` to dynamically import heavy or non-critical components:
  ```js
  import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
  const Chart = dynamic(() => import('../components/Chart'), { ssr: false });
  ```
- Only load scripts and styles for the current route.

## 4. Production Build Testing

- Always test with a production build:
  ```sh
  npm run build && npm start
  # or
  pnpm build && pnpm start
  ```
- Run Lighthouse audits against `http://localhost:3000` in production mode.

## 5. Remove Console Warnings

- Remove or comment out unnecessary `<link rel="preload" ...>` tags or scripts that cause console warnings.
- Address all warnings flagged by Lighthouse.

## 6. CDN & Caching

- Deploy to Vercel (recommended) or another CDN-backed host.
- Vercel provides automatic CDN edge caching and image optimization.
- Set proper cache headers for images, fonts, and scripts in `next.config.js` if needed.

## 7. Monitor & Iterate

- After each optimization, re-run Lighthouse and compare scores:
  - Focus on FCP, LCP, Speed Index, and Total Blocking Time.
- If a change reduces your score, revert or adjust as needed.

## 8. Real User Monitoring (RUM)

- Integrate analytics for real-world performance:
  - [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics)
  - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
  - [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/)

## 9. Accessibility & SEO

- Use Lighthouse Accessibility and SEO audits.
- Fix issues like missing alt attributes, color contrast, and heading order.

## 10. General Best Practices

- **Minimize third-party scripts:** Load with `async` or `defer` where possible.
- **Purge unused CSS:** Use TailwindCSS's purge feature to keep CSS bundles small.
- **Optimize font loading:** Use `font-display: swap` and self-host fonts if possible.
- **Bundle analysis:** Use `next build --analyze` to find and reduce large dependencies.
