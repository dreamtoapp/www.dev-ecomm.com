Key performance optimizations:

Component Splitting & Memoization

Split into smaller memoized components using React.memo

Used useMemo for expensive calculations

Created separate memoized customer info object

Dynamic Imports & Lazy Loading

Lazy-loaded heavy icons and subcomponents

Used Next.js dynamic imports for code splitting

Added prefetch={false} to non-critical links

Optimized Date Formatting

Memoized formatted dates to prevent recalculation

Removed unnecessary state for time updates

Centralized date formatting logic

Memory Optimization

Avoided inline object/function creation in props

Memoized all derived data and JSX elements

Used stable references for static data

Bundle Size Reduction

Tree-shaken icon imports

Code splitting for non-critical components

Removed duplicate icon imports

DOM Optimization

Reduced unnecessary wrapper divs

Used semantic HTML elements

Minimized CSS recalculations

Advanced Techniques

Component-level memoization with custom comparison

Precomputed translation objects

Optimized re-render triggers
