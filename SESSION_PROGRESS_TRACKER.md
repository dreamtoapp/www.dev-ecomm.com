# üìù Session Progress Tracker

_Last updated: 2025-04-24_

## Major Actions & Decisions

1. **Optimized Next.js/NextAuth app:**  
   - Removed `SessionProvider` for smaller bundles and better performance.
   - Set `fallbackNodePolyfills: false` in `next.config.js`.
2. **Documented and reported the bug:**  
   - Created a minimal reproduction project and zipped it.
   - Drafted and posted a clear GitHub issue.
   - Saved a LinkedIn/open-source contribution draft.
3. **Shared your achievements:**  
   - Created a Facebook post with Lighthouse screenshot and best hashtags.
   - Provided a list of top tech groups for wider reach.
4. **Session notes and reminders:**  
   - All drafts and summaries saved in your project folder.
   - You requested that I always keep a running session note for easy resumption.
