## [2025-04-30] Next.js 15: params & searchParams Best Practice

**Reference:** https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-15#params--searchparams

**Summary:**
- For async server components: `params` and `searchParams` are Promises and must be awaited.
- For client components: use the React `use()` hook to unwrap Promises.
- This is a breaking change from previous versions where these were plain objects.

**Example (server/async):**
```tsx
export default async function Page(props: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
  // ...
}
```

**Example (client):**
```tsx
'use client'
import { use } from 'react';
export default function Page(props: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const params = use(props.params);
  const searchParams = use(props.searchParams);
  // ...
}
```

**All new or refactored code must follow this convention.**
